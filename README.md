# Deep Learning from Scratch with Numpy

Welcome to the Deep Learning from Scratch project! This open-source project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of deep learning concepts by implementing various models entirely from scratch using Python's NumPy library.

## Project Overview

In this project, we cover the following key topics:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Neural Networks
4. Parameter Estimation
5. Back-Propagation
6. Statistical Inference 

These topics are implemented including 4 Jupyter Notebook file within this repository.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files:

1. `Simulation Study.ipynb`: Implementation of linear regression model.
2. `Logistic_Regression.ipynb`: Implementation of logistic regression model.
3. `Computation Graph.ipynb`: Implementation of neural network model.
4. `Fully connected neural network.ipynb`: Implementation of statistical inference methods.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/deep-learning-from-scratch.git
